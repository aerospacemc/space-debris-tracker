# Space Debris Tracking & Mitigation - Roadmap

Hi everyone! We're building an open-source tool for space debris tracking and mitigation, aiming to improve satellite safety and 
reduce clutter in Earth's orbit. If you're passionate about space tech and open-source development, we'd love your help! Check it out and contribute

Vision - Making Orbit Safe: Active Debris Removal as a Service (ODRaaS)

Space-Debris-tTracker Application Objectives:  
      Define operational envelope:debris target types(size/mass),altitudes, inclinations, removal rate goals
      Orbital Scenario Simulation - Identify conjunction-prone targets using historical and projected data
      Conjunction Risk reduction modeling: quantify the net benefit of removing different debris types using a Monte Carlo approach
      AI Path Planning and Dynamic Scheduling: demonstrate a convergent, safe approach to planning for multi-target missions and real-time rerouting

üöÄ Short-term Goals (Q2-Q3 2025)
- PHASE-0 Set up core architecture for GITHUB development environment
- PHASE-0 Implement basic TLE data ingestion from public satellite data sources
- PHASE-0 Develop initial visualizations of debris in orbit
- PHASE-0 Write documentation for setup and usage
- PHASE-1 Establish an active community for ongoing development and discussion
- PHASE-1 Data Acquisition: Automatically downloading Two-Line Element (TLE) data from online sources.
- PHASE-1 Short Term Orbit Prediction: Propagating orbits of debris objects to predict future positions.

üîß Medium-term Goals (Q3-Q4 2025)
- PHASE-2 Filtering and Initial Assessment: Debris Filtering, Conjunction Analysis
- PHASE-3 Risk Scoring and Feasibility: Risk Scoring, Initial Feasibility Assessment

üåç Long-term Goals (Q1-Q2 2026 and beyond)
- PHASE-4 Refinement and Expansion: Refine Orbit Prediction, Advanced Conjunction Analysis, Data Integration, Refine Feasibility Assessment, Visualization
- PHASE-5 Optimization and Deployment: Optimization, Testing and Validation, Deployment
