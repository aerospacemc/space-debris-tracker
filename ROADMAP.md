# Space Debris Tracking & Mitigation - Roadmap

Hi everyone! We're building an open-source tool for space debris tracking and mitigation, aiming to improve satellite safety and 
reduce clutter in Earth's orbit. If you're passionate about space tech and open-source development, we'd love your help! Check it out and contribute

Vision - Making Orbit Safe: Active Debris Removal as a Service (ODRaaS)

Space-Debris-tTracker Application Objectives:  
      Define operational envelope:debris target types(size/mass),altitudes, inclinations, removal rate goals
      Orbital Scenario Simulation - Identify conjunction-prone targets using historical and projected data
      Conjunction Risk reduction modeling: quantify the net benefit of removing different debris types using a Monte Carlo approach
      AI Path Planning and Dynamic Scheduling: demonstrate a convergent, safe approach to planning for multi-target missions and real-time rerouting

üöÄ Short-term Goals (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Set up core architecture for GITHUB development environment
- Implement basic TLE data ingestion from public satellite data sources
- Develop initial visualizations of debris in orbit
- Write documentation for setup and usage

üîß Medium-term Goals (Q3-Q4 2025)
- Integrate real-time tracking data streams
- Enable alerts for debris approaching predefined zones
- Implement predictive models for orbital collision risk
- Create a simple user interface for monitoring

üåç Long-term Goals (Q4 2025 and beyond)
- Support orbital debris simulation and scenario testing
- Collaborate with space agencies for data sharing
- Develop mitigation strategies and recommendations
- Establish an active community for ongoing development and discussion
