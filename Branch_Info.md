# Branch: Phase 1: Foundation - Data Acquisition & Basic Prediction

Purpose
This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 1 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-1).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.
