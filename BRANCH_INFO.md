# Branch: Phase 5: Optimization and Deployment

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 5 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-5).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 5: Optimization and Deployment

Overall Goal: To optimize the performance of the space debris tracking application and to deploy it to a production environment where it can be used by end-users.

5.1 Optimization:

Problem: The performance of the space debris tracking system can be a bottleneck, especially when processing large amounts of data or performing complex calculations.

Solution: Optimize the code to improve its performance and reduce its resource consumption.
   
Implementation Steps:
  1.    Profile the Code: Use profiling tools to identify the areas of the code that are consuming the most time and resources.
  2.    Optimize Algorithms: Improve the efficiency of the algorithms used for orbit determination, conjunction analysis, and risk scoring.
  3.    Optimize Data Structures: Choose appropriate data structures to minimize memory usage and improve data access times.
  4.    Implement Parallel Processing: Use parallel processing techniques to distribute the workload across multiple cores or machines.
  5.    Cache Data: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory.
