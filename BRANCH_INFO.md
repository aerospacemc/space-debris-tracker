# Branch: Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 4 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-4).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Overall Goal: To improve the accuracy, scope, and usability of the space debris tracking system by refining the orbit prediction models, enhancing the conjunction analysis algorithms, integrating additional data sources, improving the feasibility assessment, and adding new visualization capabilities.

4.5 Visualization:

Problem: The initial visualization capabilities are limited and don't provide a comprehensive view of the space debris environment.

Solution: Add new visualization capabilities to improve the user's understanding of the space debris environment and the risks it poses.

Implementation Steps:
*   Explore Visualization Options: Investigate different visualization libraries and techniques, such as:
    3D visualizations of debris orbits using libraries like Cesium.
    Interactive plots of conjunction probabilities using libraries like Plotly.
    Heatmaps of debris density in different orbital regions.
*   Implement New Visualizations: Choose appropriate visualizations based on your project's requirements and resources and implement them in your code.
*   Integrate Visualizations into User Interface: Integrate the new visualizations into the user interface of the tracking system.
