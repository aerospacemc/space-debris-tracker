# Branch: Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 4 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-4).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Overall Goal: To improve the accuracy, scope, and usability of the space debris tracking system by refining the orbit prediction models, enhancing the conjunction analysis algorithms, integrating additional data sources, improving the feasibility assessment, and adding new visualization capabilities.

4.1 Refine Orbit Prediction:

Problem: The accuracy of orbit predictions is limited by the simplified models used in initial TLE data processing (e.g., SGP4/SDP4). This can lead to inaccurate conjunction predictions and risk assessments.

Solution: Explore and implement more accurate orbit propagation models and techniques, such as:
*   High-Fidelity Force Models: Incorporate more detailed force models that account for factors such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational perturbations from the Sun, Moon, and other planets.
*   Numerical Integration Methods: Use numerical integration methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods) to propagate the equations of motion more accurately.
*   Data Assimilation: Incorporate observational data (e.g., radar measurements) to refine the orbit predictions.

Implementation Steps:
*   Research Advanced Orbit Propagation Techniques: Investigate different orbit propagation models and numerical integration methods.
*   Implement a Selected Technique: Choose an appropriate technique based on your project's requirements and resources and implement it in your code.
*   Validate Results: Compare the orbit predictions from the refined model with those from the original model and with observational data to assess the improvement in accuracy.
*   Document the Changes: Document the new orbit propagation technique and its impact on the accuracy of the system.

4.2 Advanced Conjunction Analysis:

Problem: The basic conjunction analysis algorithm only considers the proximity between debris objects and target satellites, but it doesn't account for the uncertainties in the orbit predictions.

Solution: Implement more advanced conjunction analysis techniques that estimate the probability of collision (POC) based on position uncertainties.

Implementation Steps:
*   Estimate Position Uncertainties: Develop methods for estimating the uncertainties in the orbit predictions, based on factors such as the age of the TLE data and the accuracy of the orbit propagation model.
*   Calculate Probability of Collision (POC): Implement a POC algorithm that takes into account the position uncertainties of the debris object and target satellite.
*   Refine Conjunction Reporting: Report the POC for each potential conjunction, in addition to the time of closest approach and distance at closest approach.

4.3 Data Integration:

Problem: The accuracy and completeness of the space debris tracking system is limited by the availability of data.

Solution: Integrate additional data sources to improve the system's awareness of the space debris environment.

Implementation Steps:
*   Identify Data Sources: Research and identify potential data sources, such as:
    Radar measurements from ground-based sensors.
    Optical measurements from ground-based telescopes.
    Data from space-based sensors.
    Data on historical collisions and fragmentation events.
*   Develop Data Ingestion Pipeline: Create a pipeline to ingest the data from the new sources, clean it, and format it for use in the tracking system.
*   Integrate Data into Tracking System: Incorporate the new data into the orbit determination and conjunction analysis algorithms.
*   Assess Improvement in Accuracy: Evaluate the impact of the new data on the accuracy and completeness of the tracking system.

4.4 Refine Feasibility Assessment:

Problem: The initial feasibility assessment only considers a few basic factors, but it doesn't account for the full range of technical, economic, and regulatory constraints.

Solution: Refine the feasibility assessment to incorporate more realistic factors, such as:

*   Mission Costs: Estimate the costs associated with different removal/mitigation technologies, including launch costs, spacecraft development costs, and operational costs.
*   Technology Readiness Level (TRL): Assess the maturity of the different removal/mitigation technologies.
*   Regulatory Constraints: Consider any international regulations or agreements that might affect the feasibility of different mitigation strategies.

Implementation Steps:
*   Research Feasibility Factors: Investigate different factors that affect the feasibility of space debris removal/mitigation.
*   Develop Cost Models: Create cost models for different removal/mitigation technologies.
*   Assess Technology Readiness: Assess the TRL of different technologies.
*   Incorporate Regulatory Constraints: Identify and incorporate any relevant regulatory constraints.
*   Refine Feasibility Assessment Algorithm: Update the feasibility assessment algorithm to include the new factors.

4.5 Visualization:

Problem: The initial visualization capabilities are limited and don't provide a comprehensive view of the space debris environment.

Solution: Add new visualization capabilities to improve the user's understanding of the space debris environment and the risks it poses.

Implementation Steps:
*   Explore Visualization Options: Investigate different visualization libraries and techniques, such as:
    3D visualizations of debris orbits using libraries like Cesium.
    Interactive plots of conjunction probabilities using libraries like Plotly.
    Heatmaps of debris density in different orbital regions.
*   Implement New Visualizations: Choose appropriate visualizations based on your project's requirements and resources and implement them in your code.
*   Integrate Visualizations into User Interface: Integrate the new visualizations into the user interface of the tracking system.
