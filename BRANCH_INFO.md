# Branch: Phase 5: Optimization and Deployment

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 5 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-5).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 5: Deployment

Overall Goal: To optimize the performance of the space debris tracking application and to deploy it to a production environment where it can be used by end-users.

5.3 Deployment:

Problem: Making the space debris tracking system available to end-users requires deploying it to a production environment.

Solution: Deploy the system to a suitable environment, such as a cloud platform or a dedicated server.

Implementation Steps:
 1.  Choose a Deployment Environment: Select a deployment environment based on your project's requirements and resources.
 2.  Containerize the Application: Use Docker or another containerization tool to package the application and its dependencies into a container.
 3.  Deploy the Container: Deploy the container to the chosen environment.
 4.  Configure the System: Configure the system to run automatically and to monitor its performance.
 5.  Provide User Access: Provide end-users with access to the system.
