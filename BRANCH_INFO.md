# Branch: Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion - Refine Orbit Prediction

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 4 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-4).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion - Refine Orbit Prediction

Overall Goal: To improve the accuracy, scope, and usability of the space debris tracking system by refining the orbit prediction models, enhancing the conjunction analysis algorithms, integrating additional data sources, improving the feasibility assessment, and adding new visualization capabilities.

4.1 Refine Orbit Prediction:

Problem: The accuracy of orbit predictions is limited by the simplified models used in initial TLE data processing (e.g., SGP4/SDP4). This can lead to inaccurate conjunction predictions and risk assessments.

Solution: Explore and implement more accurate orbit propagation models and techniques, such as:
*   High-Fidelity Force Models: Incorporate more detailed force models that account for factors such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational perturbations from the Sun, Moon, and other planets.
*   Numerical Integration Methods: Use numerical integration methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta methods) to propagate the equations of motion more accurately.
*   Data Assimilation: Incorporate observational data (e.g., radar measurements) to refine the orbit predictions.

Implementation Steps:
*   Research Advanced Orbit Propagation Techniques: Investigate different orbit propagation models and numerical integration methods.
*   Implement a Selected Technique: Choose an appropriate technique based on your project's requirements and resources and implement it in your code.
*   Validate Results: Compare the orbit predictions from the refined model with those from the original model and with observational data to assess the improvement in accuracy.
*   Document the Changes: Document the new orbit propagation technique and its impact on the accuracy of the system.
