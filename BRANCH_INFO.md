# Branch: Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 4 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-4).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 4: Refinement and Expansion

Overall Goal: To improve the accuracy, scope, and usability of the space debris tracking system by refining the orbit prediction models, enhancing the conjunction analysis algorithms, integrating additional data sources, improving the feasibility assessment, and adding new visualization capabilities.


4.4 Refine Feasibility Assessment:

Problem: The initial feasibility assessment only considers a few basic factors, but it doesn't account for the full range of technical, economic, and regulatory constraints.

Solution: Refine the feasibility assessment to incorporate more realistic factors, such as:

*   Mission Costs: Estimate the costs associated with different removal/mitigation technologies, including launch costs, spacecraft development costs, and operational costs.
*   Technology Readiness Level (TRL): Assess the maturity of the different removal/mitigation technologies.
*   Regulatory Constraints: Consider any international regulations or agreements that might affect the feasibility of different mitigation strategies.

Implementation Steps:
*   Research Feasibility Factors: Investigate different factors that affect the feasibility of space debris removal/mitigation.
*   Develop Cost Models: Create cost models for different removal/mitigation technologies.
*   Assess Technology Readiness: Assess the TRL of different technologies.
*   Incorporate Regulatory Constraints: Identify and incorporate any relevant regulatory constraints.
*   Refine Feasibility Assessment Algorithm: Update the feasibility assessment algorithm to include the new factors.
