# Branch: Phase 5: Optimization and Deployment - Testing and Validation

Purpose: This repository serves as the home for code developed and tested specifically for Phase 5 of the project.

Development Workflow:
*   Developers fork the main repository to contribute.
*   They create feature branches within their forks for specific tasks (e.g., feature/automated-tle-download).
*   Developers implement and rigorously test their code within these feature branches.
*   Once a feature is ready, they submit a pull request (PR) to merge their changes into the designated phase branch (e.g., phase-5).
*   The pull request undergoes code review and discussion.
*   After approval, the PR is merged into the phase branch, integrating the new code into the project.

## Requirements

Phase 5: Optimization and Deployment - Testing and Validation

Overall Goal: To optimize the performance of the space debris tracking application and to deploy it to a production environment where it can be used by end-users.

5.2 Testing and Validation:

Problem: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the space debris tracking system is critical, especially for safety-critical applications.

Solution: Implement a comprehensive testing and validation plan to ensure that the system is functioning correctly and producing accurate results.

Implementation Steps:
  1.  Provide User Access: Provide end-users with access to the system.
  2.  Unit Tests: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of individual functions and modules.
  3.  Integration Tests: Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components of the system.
  4.  System Tests: Perform system tests to verify the overall functionality of the system.
  5.  Performance Tests: Perform performance tests to measure the speed and resource consumption of the system.
  6.  Accuracy Validation: Compare the system's results with independent sources of data to validate its accuracy.
